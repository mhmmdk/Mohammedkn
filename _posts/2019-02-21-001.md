<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<div class="problem">
<p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>
</div>

<h3>Solution 1: Mathematical View.</h3>
<p>Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ... Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ... Multiples of 15(3 &amp; 5): 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, ...</p>
<p>So we were asked the sum of arithmetic progression - arithmetic series. This can be solved by the equation of arithmetic series. You can read it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression">here. Arithmetic progression</a>.</p>
<p>Using the equation of arithmetic series: The arithmetic series of multiples of 3 below 1000 is 333 * (3 + 999) / 2 = <span class="answer">166833.0</span>. The arithmetic series of multiples of 5 below 1000 is 199 * (5 + 995) / 2 = <span class="answer">99500</span>. The arithmetic series of multiples of 15 below 1000 is 66 * (15 + 990) / 2 = <span class="answer">33165</span>. We are not asked to add multiples of 15 but we need to subtruct multiples of 15 since it was counted on both side.</p>
<p>So the answer is summing the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 and subtructing sum multiples of 15. 
<p> The output: <span class='answer'> 233168 </span></p>
<p> This only takes pencil and paper. May be calculator.</p>

<h3>Solution 2: Brute Forcing.</h3>
<p>Let's go through all natural numbers below 1000 and add to our variable if it is divisible by 3 or 5.</p>
<p>Here is my <code>code in python</code>:  

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<br><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">n</span>
<br><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">total</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div></p>

<p> The output: <span class='answer'>233168 </span></p>
<p>This code run <span class='red'> ~0.0</span>. So may be there is not the room for improvement!</p> 

<h3>Solution 3: Improved Brute Forcing.</h3>
<p>We can improve this by making the iteration to the candidates. By iterating through multiples of 15 and adding the pattern of multiples of 3 and 5, we will reduce the iteration from 999 to 66.</p>
<p><code>Improved code</code>:  

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<br><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">990</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">30</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">n</span> 
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">30</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">n</span> 
<br><span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">993</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">996</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">999</span>
<span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">995</span>
<br><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">total</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The output: <span class='answer'>233168 </span></p>
<p>This code run <span class='red'> </span>~0.0</p>
