<div class="problem"><h3>Problem 5</h3>
<p>2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.</p>
<p>What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?</p>
</div>

<h3>Solution 1: Maths</h3>
<p>1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10 = 3628800 can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 but not the smallest nor the greatest of this kind.
10*9 which implies it is divisible by 10, 9, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1. We only need to multiply it by 4 to make it divisible by 8. So 10*9*4*7 is divisible for number between 1 to 11.
<br>Similarly:
20*19*9*17*4*7*13*11 = <span class='answer'>232792560</span> would be divisible by number between 1 and 21. That is the answer.</p>

<h3>Solution 2: Brute Forcing</h3>
<p>Help yourself!<br>This is when you dont want to use maths.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">20</span>
<span class="n">found</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<br><span class="k">while</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">found</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">21</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">break</span>
        <span class="n">found</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="mi">20</span>
<br>    <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><br>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n<span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span></span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This code run: ~484.1459057331085s.
<br>The output: <span class="answer">232792560</span>. Still correct.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: coral"> Note: </span> We can reduce redundancy of checking for 2, 4, 8 while we know it is divisible by 16. We may iterate for multiples of 20 cause the number we want is also multiples of 20.</p>
