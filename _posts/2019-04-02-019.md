<h3>Problem 19</h3>   
<p>You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.
<br><br>
    1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.<br>
    Thirty days has September,<br>
    April, June and November.<br>
    All the rest have thirty-one,<br>
    Saving February alone,<br>
    Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.<br>
    And on leap years, twenty-nine.<br>
    A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.<br>

<h3>Solution 1</h3>   

```python   
def isleap(year):
    if not year%100:
        if not year%400:
            return 29
        return 28
    if not year%4:
        return 29
    return 28

def firstdayofmonth(month, year):
    days = 0  
    for y in range(year - 1900 if year>1900 else 1900-year):
        days += sum([31,isleap(1900+y),31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31])
        
    days += sum([31,isleap(year),31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31][:month])
    return (days+1)%7


ans = 0
y = 1901
while y <= 2000:
    for m in range(12):
        if not firstdayofmonth(m, y):
            ans += 1
    y += 1

print(ans)   
```   

<h3>Solution 2: A bit wrong</h3>
```python   
def isleap(year):
    if not year%100:
        if not year%400:
            return 29
        return 28
    if not year%4:
        return 29
    return 28


ans = 0
days = 0
for y in range(1, 101):
    days += sum([31,isleap(1900+y),31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31])

    month = 0
    for m in [31,isleap(1900+y),31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31]:
        month += m
        if not (days+1+month)%7:
            ans += 1


print(ans)   
```
