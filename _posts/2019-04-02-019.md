<h3>Problem 19</h3>   
<p>You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.
<br><br>
    1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.<br>
    Thirty days has September,<br>
    April, June and November.<br>
    All the rest have thirty-one,<br>
    Saving February alone,<br>
    Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.<br>

<h3>Solution 1</h3>   

```python   
def isleap(year):
    if not year%100:
        if not year%400:
            return 29
        return 28
    if not year%4:
        return 29
    return 28


ans = 0
days = sum([31,isleap(1900),31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31])

for y in range(1, 101):
    
    month = 0
    for m in [0,31,isleap(1900+y),31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30]:
        month += m
        if not (days+1+month)%7:
            ans += 1

    days += sum([31,isleap(1900+y),31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31])


print(ans)   
```
