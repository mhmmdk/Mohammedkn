<h3>Problem 27</h3>
<p>
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
<br> 
<br>
<var>n<sup>2</sup>+n+41</var>  
<br>
<br>
It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values <var>0≤n≤39</var>. However, when <var>n=40,40<sup>2</sup>+40+41=40(40+1)+41</var> is divisible by 41, and certainly when <var>n=41,41<sup>2</sup>+41+41</var> is clearly divisible by 41.
<br>
<br>
The incredible formula <var>n<sup>2</sup>−79n+1601</var> was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values <var>0≤n≤79</var>. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.
<br>
<br>
Considering quadratics of the form:
<br>
<var>n<sup>2</sup>+an+b</var>, where |a|<1000 and |b|≤1000
<br>
where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
<br>
e.g. |11|=11 and |−4|=4
