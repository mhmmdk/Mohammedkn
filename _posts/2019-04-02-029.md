<h3>Problem 29</h3>
<p>
Consider all integer combinations of ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 5:
<br>
<br>2<sup>2</sup>=4, 2<sup>3</sup>=8, 2<sup>4</sup>=16, 2<sup>5</sup>=32   
3<sup>2</sup>=9, 3<sup>3</sup>=27, 3<sup>4</sup>=81, 3<sup>5</sup>=243   
4<sup>2</sup>=16, 4<sup>3</sup>=64, 4<sup>4</sup>=256, 4<sup>5</sup>=1024   
5<sup>2</sup>=25, 5<sup>3</sup>=125, 5<sup>4</sup>=625, 5<sup>5</sup>=3125   
<br>
<br>
If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:
<br>
<br>
4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125
